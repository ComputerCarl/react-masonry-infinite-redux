# Infinite Redux

Plagued with problems of petulant pinboards, I created the repo to demonstrate.
There are features not needed for this demo, but I use this as a template

It uses/features;
* Razzle for server-side rendering
* A fake API card generator
* `react-masonry-infinite`
* Demonstrates use `react-router` with `redux`
* Prevent infinite async issues using an infinite scroller
* Caching by the awesome `react-component-caching`; brought render from >4s to ~500ms in a couple of lines of code (in another SSR project).


## ToDo
- [ ] click to delete
- [ ] set number of tiles (currently 95)
- [ ] demonstrate caching with header component
- [ ] problem with keys in infinite scroller?
